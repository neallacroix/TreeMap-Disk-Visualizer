# TreeMap server image — multi-stage: compile with dev deps, run on a slim
# Node 20 base with production deps only.
#
# Inside the container the server binds 0.0.0.0 (a 127.0.0.1 bind would be
# unreachable through the published port); docker-compose.yml maps it to
# 127.0.0.1 on the HOST by default, so out of the box the app stays
# localhost-only — the same posture as running it directly. Widen the port
# mapping and set TREEMAP_TOKEN when you actually want remote access.
#
# A container has no OS Trash and no display: treat this profile as
# scan-and-analyze (mount data read-only); destructive actions belong to the
# desktop app or a host-run server.
